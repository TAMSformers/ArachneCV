\#\-Arachne\-C\-V

Written by David Hashe and Jacob Brunson

\subsection*{Introduction}

Arachne\-C\-V is a Computer Vision library developed by F\-R\-C \#5212 T\-A\-M\-Sformers for use in the F\-I\-R\-S\-T Robotics Competition. It extends Open\-C\-V with a compact and well-\/documented A\-P\-I suitable for novice and expert programmers alike.

Bindings are available to all languages supported by S\-W\-I\-G.

\subsection*{Building Arachne\-C\-V}

Arachne\-C\-V uses C\-Make, a popular cross-\/platform build system. As such, it may be built on Linux, Mac, and Windows.

To build Arachne\-C\-V, first make sure that Open\-C\-V, S\-W\-I\-G, C\-Make, and a C++ compiler are present on your system.

Next change into the Arachne\-C\-V directory and follow the instructions below.

\paragraph*{Linux \& O\-S X}

\begin{DoxyVerb}mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
make install
\end{DoxyVerb}


\paragraph*{Windows\-:}

\subsection*{Developer Information}

Arachne\-C\-V is designed with the intent of binding to arbitrary high-\/level languages to make it equally accessible to F\-R\-C teams of all language backgrounds. This is done through S\-W\-I\-G. However, because S\-W\-I\-G only supports the C++ Standard Library and not Open\-C\-V, proxy classes have been created to mediate between S\-W\-I\-G and Open\-C\-V. Internal classes and functions are prefixed \char`\"{}acv\char`\"{}, which proxy classes lack.

Furthermore, all files relying on Open\-C\-V are suffixed \char`\"{}acv\char`\"{}, while all files containing proxy classes are suffixed \char`\"{}proxy\char`\"{}.

Arachne\-C\-V documentation is generated through Doxygen.

\subsection*{Name Explanation}

In Greek mythology, Arachne was a talented and proud weaver who rivaled Athena in her abilities. Much like the spider Arachne was transformed into, Arachne\-C\-V works by creating and processing a \char`\"{}web\char`\"{} of camera inputs. Through this, it creates a beautiful and functional structure.
